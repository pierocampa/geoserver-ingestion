This folder contains the definition of the permissions
to be set on the layers of EDP GeoNode instance for
the EO/CDR research group.

By default a new layer that gets imported from GeoServer
to the EDP GeoNode with a single user owner:

  $ python manage.py updatelayers [...] -u $OWNER

To programmatically specify a more articulated set of 
permissions, there is another command in the GeoNode suite
of utilities:

  $ python manage.py set_layers_permissions --help
  usage: manage.py set_layers_permissions [-h] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}]
                                          [--settings SETTINGS]
                                          [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH]
                                          [--traceback] [--no-color]
                                          [--force-color]
                                          [-r [RESOURCES [RESOURCES ...]]]
                                          [-p PERMISSION]
                                          [-u [USERS [USERS ...]]]
                                          [-g [GROUPS [GROUPS ...]]] [-d]

      Set/Unset permissions on layers for users and groups.
      Arguments:
          - users (-u, --users)
          - groups (-g, --groups)
          - resources (-r, --resources)
          - permissions (-p, --permissions)
          - delete (-d, --delete)
      At least one user or one group is required.
      If no resources are typed all the layers will be considered.
      At least one permission must be typed.
      Multiple inputs can be typed with white space separator.
      To unset permissions use the '--delete (-d)' option.
      To assign permissions to everyone (anonymous users), you will need to
      add the following options: '-u AnonymousUser -g anonymous'


A cronjob runs every N minutes on this host, in order to keep
GeoServer and EDP GeoNode syncrhonized:

   /opt/geonode/update_layers_cdr.sh

In order to instruct this script on how to set the permissions
to all layers, we decided to define a directory tree as follows:

   ~pcampalani/geonode/perms/$WORKSPACE/$STORE/$PERM/$LAYER_NAME.perms

being:

   WORKSPACE : the GeoServer workspace
   STORE     : the GeoServer store
   PERM      : one among 'read', 'write', 'download', and 'owner'

Each $PERM folder will contain at least two files:

   users.default
      The CSV list of default users to which to assign the $PERM
   groups.default
      The CSV list of default groups to which to assign the $PERM

All .perms layers files with empty content in a given $PERM folder 
will be set to the users/groups defined in the .default files.

Otherwise, .perms layer file can define a specific users/groups permission
assignment by setting one or both of:

   U:user1[, user2[, ...]]
   G:group1[, group2[, ...]]

Hence a CSV list of users and groups, keyed by U: and G: respectively.

Whenever a .perms file is defined, both users and groups defaults settings
are ignored for that layer.

If permissions file are empty, and there are no defaults set, no permission will be set on the layers.
