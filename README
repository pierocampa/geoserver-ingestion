This folder contains the utilities for loading the data to the SDI.
Each dataset will use these tools to get published via DATASET_NAME.sh script
located in its folder.

Publishing a dataset means ingestion into a PostGIS database defined
in the ``pg_conn'' file, then publication as layer on the GeoServer
instance defined in the ``gs_conn'' file.
